Changes to the instruction decode PLA/ROM

A significant part of the random logic of the 6502 may be viewed
as a space-optimized OR plane of the instruction decode PLA/ROM.
To bring this out more clearly (and hence make the random logic
easier to follow) the following changes have been made.

1. Some of the lines of the AND plane have been reordered.
2. The timing control lines of the read-modify-write cycle (denoted
MEMOP/TA, TM and TW) have been fed into the AND plane.
3. A couple of circuits have been simplified, notably in the logic
driving the DL/DB control line and the ALU carry in.

Other circuit differences

1. Some copies of the br3 (branch T3) PLA output have been combined
(e.g. by omitting a double inverter).
2. Some copies of the ready-phi1 signal have been combined.
3. The same circuit has been used for both halves of the decimal
half carry (the 6502 has slightly different, but logically equivalent
circuits for the two nibbles).

Other layout differences

1. Very little account is taken of differing transistor sizes, and (for
clarity) wires do not pass over transistors.
2. The instruction predecode logic has been laid out as a mini-PLA.
3. The B flag flip-flop has been moved closer to the PLA.
4. The reset, ready, set overflow and clock pads have been reordered.
5. Ready control has been moved more centrally.
6. The T1/SYNC flip-flop has been localized in the program control logic
(in the original 6502 this flip-flop stretches across the chip).
7. There are some differences in the layout of the clocks, ground and
power, and these are not laid out properly as wires.
8. The interrupt address lines cross the centre of the chip in different
place from the original.
9. The pull-ups for the data path buses have been moved to convenient places.
10. The ALU overflow and carry outputs have been routed alongside bit7 of
the datapath and then directly into the flags i/o.
